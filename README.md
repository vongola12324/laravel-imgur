# laravel-imgur
A very very simple imgur client for laravel 5.5/5.6

## Installation
```
composer require vongola12324/laravel-imgur
```

## Feature
Because of some reasons, this project can only do:
- Upload Photo
- Delete uploaded photo by hash

## Notice
1. It is recommended not to use this project in a formal project (because it has not been officially released yet) unless you understand what you are doing!
2. Alough the final goal is finish all function in api, but I do not have many time to maintain this project, so you can become a contributor of this project, or fork this project.
